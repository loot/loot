The linked Discord message is:

> And even if I could support it, the moment anyone anywhere adds or removes an ESL flag, everything is going to come crashing down like a house of cards, made from sliver thin glass
> if a ESL flag is added or removed to a module that any other module uses as master, it will shift the required File FormIDs inside these other modules up or down

> just that it doesn't require changes to that file, all that's needed to make it all fail is for some other file that you are using as a master to change the ESL flag

That's in reference to some decompiled code for how FormIDs in plugins are mapped to runtime FormIDs. That code is:

> ```c
> void __fastcall sub_1414D4888(FormRef *ref, TESFile *file)
> {
>   uint32_t formid = ref->formid;
>   if ( ref->formid - 1 > 0x7FE && file && formid + 0x1000000 > 0xFFFFFE )
>   {
>     master_reader = fGetFileFromMasterFilteredLists(&file->master_lists.filtered_files, formid);
>     if ( !master_reader )
>       master_reader = file;
>     fToRuntimeFormId(master_reader, &formid);
>     ref->formid = formid;
>   }
> }
