# Licenses

BOSS uses a number of libraries, and their licenses are listed in this file.

* Alphanum - zlib license; the text is not included as allowed by the license.
* Boost - Boost Software License v1.0; see "Boost Software License v1.0.txt" for the text.
* Libespm - GNU GPL v3; see "GNU GPL v3.txt" for the text.
* Libgit2 - GNU GPL v2; see "GNU GPL v2 (libgit2).txt" for the text.
* Libloadorder - GNU GPL v3; see "GNU GPL v3.txt" for the text.
* PugiXML - MIT License; see "MIT License (PugiXML).txt" for the text.
* wxWidgets - wxWindows License; the text is not included as allowed by the license.
* yaml-cpp - MIT License; see "MIT License (yaml-cpp).txt" for the text.
* zlib - zlib license; the text is not included as allowed by the license.

BOSS is also distributed with some binaries for the following programs:

* Subversion - Apache License v1.0; see "Apache License v1.0.txt" for the text.
* GraphViz - Eclipse Public License v1.0; the text is not included as allowed by the license. 

Going by what the EPL FAQ page says, simply running the GraphVis binaries through system calls does not make BOSS a "derivative work", and so it is not bound by the EPL, and so it's OK for BOSS to use GraphVis even though the EPL and GPL are incompatible.

Source code for all libraries and binaries can be found on the websites linked to in the main BOSS readme.
