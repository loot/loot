LOOT is a utility that helps users avoid serious conflicts between their mods by
setting their plugins in an optimal load order. It also provides tens of
thousands of plugin-specific messages, including usage notes, requirements,
incompatibilities, bug warnings and installation mistake notifications, and
thousands of Bash Tag suggestions.

This metadata that LOOT supplies is stored in its masterlist, which is
maintained by the LOOT team using information provided by mod authors and users.
Users can also add to and modify the metadata used by LOOT through the use of
userlist files. The LOOT API provides a way for third-party developers to access
this metadata for use in their own programs.
