LOOT is a plugin load order optimiser for TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion, Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, TES V: Skyrim, Enderal: Forgotten Stories, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, TES V: Skyrim VR, Enderal: Forgotten Stories (Special Edition), Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR. It is designed to assist mod users in avoiding detrimental conflicts, by automatically calculating a load order that satisfies all plugin dependencies and maximises each plugin's impact on the user's game.

LOOT also provides some load order error checking, including checks for requirements, incompatibilities and cyclic dependencies. In addition, it provides a large number of plugin-specific usage notes, bug warnings and Bash Tag suggestions for Wrye Bash.

While LOOT is able to calculate correct load order positions for the vast majority of plugins using only their content, it cannot do so for all plugins. As such, LOOT provides a mechanism for supplying additional plugin metadata so that it may sort them correctly. An online *masterlist* is provided to supply metadata for many plugins that need it, while users can make their own metadata additions, which are saved in their *userlist*.

LOOT is intended to make using mods easier, and mod users should still possess a working knowledge of mod load ordering. See `Introduction To Load Orders`_ for an overview.
