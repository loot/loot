LOOT is a plugin load order optimiser for:

* Starfield
* The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind
* The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion
* The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
* The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition (and Anniversary Edition)
* The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR
* Fallout 3
* Fallout: New Vegas
* Fallout 4
* Fallout 4 VR
* Nehrim: At Fate's Edge
* Enderal: Forgotten Stories
* Enderal: Forgotten Stories (Special Edition)

LOOT can automatically calculate a load order that satisfies all plugin dependencies and maximises each plugin's impact on your game. It can also detect many issues, and provides a large number of plugin-specific usage notes, warnings and Bash Tag suggestions for Wrye Bash.

While LOOT can correctly handle the vast majority of plugins without help, some plugins need additional metadata to be sorted correctly. LOOT has a masterlist of metadata for each supported game, and you can add more to customise LOOT's behaviour.

LOOT helps make using mods easier, and you should still possess a working knowledge of mod load ordering. See `Introduction To Load Orders`_ for an overview.
