Contributing & Support
**********************

LOOT is very much a community project, and contributions from its users are very welcome, whether they be metadata, translations, code or anything else. The best way to contribute is to `make changes yourself`_ at GitHub! It's the fastest way to get changes you want applied, and you'll get your name automatically immortalised in our `credits`_.

If you encounter an issue with LOOT, check the `Frequently Asked Questions`_ page in case a solution is available there.
Otherwise, general discussion and support takes place in LOOT's official forum thread, which is linked to on `LOOT's homepage`_.

If you want to submit metadata, the easiest way to do so is to add the metadata to your own LOOT install, then use the Copy Metadata feature to easily get it in a form that you can then edit into a masterlist on GitHub or post in the official `forum thread`_.

Information on dirty plugins is very welcome, but for such information to be useful we require at least the filename and the CRC of the dirty plugin. The CRC may be calculated using Wrye Bash or 7-Zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-Zip, the "CRC checksum for data" is the one required. Any other information, such as the ITM record and deleted reference counts, is very welcome.
