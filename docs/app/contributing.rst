Contributing & Support
**********************

LOOT is very much a community project, and contributions from its users are very welcome, whether they be metadata, translations, code or anything else. The best way to contribute is to `make changes yourself`_ at GitHub! It's the fastest way to get changes you want applied, and you'll get your name automatically immortalised in our `credits`_.

If you encounter an issue with LOOT, check the `Frequently Asked Questions`_ page in case a solution is available there.
Otherwise, general discussion and support takes place in LOOT's official `forum thread`_ or on our `Discord`_ server, which are also linked to on `LOOT's homepage`_.

If you want to submit metadata, the easiest way to do so is to add the metadata to your own LOOT install, then use the Copy Metadata feature to easily get it in a form that you can then edit into a masterlist on GitHub or post in the official forum thread.

Information on dirty plugins is very welcome in the form of |QAC|_ reports from xEdit. In addition to the QAC report we also require a link to a plugins source, so we can always verify and reevaluate the plugin at a later date. Please also check if the masterlist already includes information on the plugin in question.

For safety and usability, links to mods must follow these guidelines:
  * The link should refer to an official/canonical/supported source, as opposed to unverified uploads.
  * Whenever possible, the url should use ``https`` instead of ``http``.
  * The plugin in question mustn't be behind a paywall of any sort.
  * The LOOT Team reserves the right to reject URLs to websites that contain illegal content.
