Installation & Uninstallation
*****************************

**LOOT requires Windows 7 or later.**

LOOT can be installed either using its automated installer or manually. If you are using the installer, just run it and follow the wizard steps. If installing manually, extract the downloaded archive to a location of your choice.

The official LOOT releases require the `MSVC 2019 x86 redistributable`_ to be installed. The installer automatically downloads and installs it if you don't already have it installed, but if you use the LOOT archive then you will need to do so manually.

If LOOT was installed using the installer, then use the uninstaller linked to in the Start Menu to uninstall LOOT. If LOOT was installed manually:

1. Delete the files you extracted from the location you chose.
2. Delete the ``LOOT`` folder in your local application data folder, which can be accessed by entering ``%LOCALAPPDATA%`` into Windows' File Explorer.
