Themes can be selected in LOOT's settings dialog. Two themes are provided with LOOT: the default theme and a dark theme.

Additional themes may be installed in the ``resources/themes`` directory, relative to ``LOOT.exe``. A theme is defined by a single ``<theme name>.theme.qss`` Qt Style Sheet file.
