Themes can be selected in LOOT's settings dialog. Two themes are provided with LOOT: the default theme and a dark theme.

If you're running LOOT on Linux with a dark system theme, then depending on your system configuration you may get better results with LOOT's default theme than with its dark theme.

Additional themes may be installed in the ``themes`` directory in LOOT's application data directory (at ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\LOOT`` on Windows). A theme is defined by a single ``<theme name>.theme.qss`` Qt Style Sheet file, or a pair of ``<theme name>-light.theme.qss`` and ``<theme name>-dark.theme.qss`` files that are used when the system colour scheme is light or dark respectively.
