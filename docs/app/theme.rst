Themes can be selected in LOOT's settings dialog. Two themes are provided with LOOT: the default theme and a dark theme.

Additional themes may be installed in the ``themes`` directory in LOOT's application data directory (at ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\LOOT`` on Windows). A theme is defined by a single ``<theme name>.theme.qss`` Qt Style Sheet file.
